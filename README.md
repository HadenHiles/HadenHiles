<h1 align="center">I create software for hockey players.</h1>
<br />

Like many software engineers, my life is a constant balancing act between playing hockey, making YouTube videos, family, and a never ending stream of software ideas.

What? That's not how you imagine a software engineer spending his time? I guess that explains why nobody I've ever worked with likes to take breaks from coding to shoot hockey pucks...

I've always been motivated by hockey. The unique feeling I get when I score a goal, or pull off a sweet move, is something that I continually strive for. Which is why when I designed my first website, edited my first YouTube video, and had that familiar feeling of accomplishment; I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

I'm lucky to be able to split my time between making YouTube videos with [@CoachJeremy](https://youtube.com/CoachJeremy), working on [The Pond](https://thepond.howtohockey.com), and building out my own portfolio of [software projects](https://github.com/HadenHiles) and [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/HadenHiles).

# Portfolio Website - Flutter
This project is built with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). To get started, follow their [installation instructions](https://flutter.dev/get-started/) and their [documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).

## Cloning
If you would like to use this project for your own website, all I ask is that you subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/HadenHiles) and share your website in the comments so I can see how you used it!
