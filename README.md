<h1 align="center">üèí Building Cool Stuff for Hockey Players & Humans Alike üöÄ</h1>
<br />

As a full-stack developer, I specialize in building modern web and mobile applications, with a strong focus on Flutter, PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, and cloud technologies. My work spans SaaS platforms, interactive games, sports analytics, and community-driven tools‚Äîoften blending my passion for hockey with innovative software solutions.

## üèíüé¨ When I'm Not Coding...

When I'm not coding up a storm, I'm usually lacing up my skates, trying out a new hockey challenge, or letting AI and tech make my life a little more interesting. On my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@HadenHiles), you'll find me trying goalie for the first time, experimenting with gear and tape jobs, building apps for hockey players, and sometimes just seeing what happens when I follow the internet's wildest ideas. If you like honest experiments, a bit of self-deprecating humor, and a mix of hockey and tech, come hang out!
