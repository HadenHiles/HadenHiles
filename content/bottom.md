# WHAT I DO

Like many software engineers, my life is a constant balancing act between playing hockey, family get to gethers, making YouTube videos, and a never ending stream of software ideas.

What? That's not how you imagine a software engineer spending his time? I guess that explains why nobody I've ever worked with likes to take breaks from coding to make TikToks and shoot hockey pucks...

I've always been motivated by hockey. The unique feeling I get when I score a goal, or pull off a sick move, is something that I continually strive for. It's an addiction. Which is why when I designed my first website, finished editing my first YouTube video, and had that familiar feeling of accomplishment; I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

I'm lucky to be able to split my time between making YouTube videos with [@CoachJeremy](https://youtube.com/CoachJeremy), working on [The Pond](https://thepond.howtohockey.com), and building out my own portfolio of [software projects](https://github.com/HadenHiles) and [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/HadenHiles).
